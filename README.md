Project Description:
This project is a 2D arcade-style dodging game implemented using Processing (Java).
The player controls a spaceship and avoids incoming space rocks while collecting score to beat the highest score.
This project is shared as an example to the final project of this COMP1000 unit.
 
Semester Topic Integration:
This project demonstrates core concepts of interactive programming covered in this semester, including:
 - Object-Oriented Programming (OOP): Custom classes for Spaceship, Rock, and Star.
 - 2D Graphics: Use of Processing shapes (ellipse, triangle) to draw objects.
 - Event Handling: Real-time user input through keyboard (WASD/Arrow keys, SPACE, R).
 - Arrays and Loops: Managing and updating multiple objects (rocks and stars) with arrays and for-loops.
 - Game Logic: Collision detection, scoring system, and game state control.
 
Instructions:
 - Use Arrow keys or WASD to move the spaceship.
 - Avoid hitting the rocks.
 - Press SPACE to start and R to restart.
 - Press ESC to terminate the game.
